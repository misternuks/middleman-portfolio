  description: Designed for tabletop game masters to aid their storytelling, this web application integrates AI-generated texts with user-provided parameters to generate personalized narrative snippets. This project demonstrates my front-end design capabilities, my back-end programming skills, my advanced knowledge of CRUD methods in a static Postgresql database, and my capability as a project manager (I oversaw and controlled feature merging in GitHub and handled production deployment and custom DNS configuration in Heroku).
