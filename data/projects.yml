  description: This app is being built as part of a government-funded research project at a language university. The app allows students to receive personalized tutoring sessions from an AI-powered chat partner. The app sends class and lesson-specific data to OpenAI via an API call, and the response is framed as a one-to-one live chat between a student and an AI tutor. I am serving as sole fullstack developer for the project.

  description: This Ruby on Rails project demonstrates my ability to design a many-to-many (n:n) relational database schema; build the models, controllers, and routes for the different tables; and design view pages for users to interact with the database via CRUD methods (creating, reading, updating, and deleting instances of the models). In this case, users can create movie watchlists, then add movies (via a 'bookmark' join table) to the lists.
