  description: This Ruby on Rails project demonstrates my ability to design a many-to-many (n:n) relational database schema; build the models, controllers, and routes for the different tables; and design view pages for users to interact with the database via CRUD methods (creating, reading, updating, and deleting instances of the models). In this case, users can create movie watchlists, then add movies (via a 'bookmark' join table) to the lists.

  description: Designed for tabletop game masters to aid their storytelling, this web application integrates AI-generated texts with user-provided parameters to generate personalized narrative snippets. This project demonstrates my front-end design capabilities, my back-end programming skills, my advanced knowledge of CRUD methods in a static Postgresql database, and my capability as a project manager (I oversaw and controlled feature merging in GitHub and handled production deployment and custom DNS configuration in Heroku).
